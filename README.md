This project was carried out by the members of Coding titans after we began studying React in other to test our knowledge on using React components, Vite, props and the .map method to make our code cleaner and reusable.
The project consists of:

Header component: Displays a header section.

Card component: Represents individual data items.

App component: Main component that orchestrates the rendering of the header and the data cards.

The data is looped through using the .map() method, rendering individual Card components for each data item.

How to Run:
Clone this repository.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Run the project using npm start.
